OnlyPass - Secure Password Management

OnlyPass is a desktop password manager that creates and manages highly secure passwords. This app allows users to generate strong passwords, which can be changed periodically for enhanced security. With a user-friendly interface and a focus on privacy, OnlyPass ensures that your passwords are always under your control.

Features:

Password Generation: Create new, secure passwords with a click of a button.
Easy-to-Change Passwords: Simplify the process of changing your passwords regularly.
Local Storage: Your passwords are stored locally on your device, not in the cloud.
User Control: No need to trust external servers; you control your security.
This project is developed by one person and is open-source, so feel free to contribute, fork, or simply use the application for your password management needs.

Installation:

Follow the instructions in the repository to build and run the app for your respective desktop platform (only Windows for now).
